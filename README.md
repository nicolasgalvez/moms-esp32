# Mom's ESP32
My mom loves her garden. This project is to help her track the tempature, moisture, etc.

# Goals
1. Create a device using ESP32 that will have an easy wifi setup mode, run on solar power, and include a web interface for calibrating the sensors.
2. Track the sensor data using a remote Laravel app probably running on a Coolify instance. I would use AWS serverless but I need to get back into Laravel for a job.
3. Design and print an enclosure using food-safe PETG with a stainless steel nozzle (brass can leach lead), and weather treat it.
4. Power with solar panel and rechargable battery.

## Nice to have
1. OTA firmware updates.
2. Plugin for Middleware like discord/slack notifications and alerts.
3. Interface for solinoid or valve to control watering based on certain conditions.
4. Interface for camera/motion sensors like wildlife camera.
5. Integration with AI to analyze data or visually monitor plant health/pests.
